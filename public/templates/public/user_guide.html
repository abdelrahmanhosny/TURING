                        ADAM is a web-based tool for the analysis and visualization of the dynamics of multi-state,
                        discrete models of biological networks. Multi-state discrete models are characterized by a
                        collection of functions. For a network of n nodes, the corresponding discrete model will have n
                        functions, where the i-th function describes the state transitions of the i-th node in the
                        network. The user may select one of four inputs: a GINsim file, a PDS (polynomial dynamical
                        system), a PDSep (polynomial dynamical system with external parameters), a PBN (probabilistic
                        Boolean network), or an SDDS (stochastic discrete dynamical system). The user may upload a file
                        or enter functions into the text box. Based upon which input type the user selects, other input
                        options may appear. The user is guided through additional input/output options. ADAM can
                        calculate fixed points and limit cycles of a specified length, produce the dependency graph for
                        all networks and the state space for networks which are simulated, the graph of trajectories
                        starting from a given initial state, and identify functional circuits along with their signed
                        edges. ADAM analyzes dynamics using a combination of simulation and abstract algebra techniques.
                        The method of computation and the output will depend on options selected by the user.

                                ADAM can analyze Logical Models generated with <a
                                    href="http://gin.univ-mrs.fr/">GINsim</a>. GINsim is a program to build a logical
                                model for a biological system such as a gene regulatory network. Internally, ADAM
                                converts a logical model to a polynomial dynamical system (PDS) via the method described
                                in Veliz-Cuba et al., 2010<sup>1</sup> and then uses techniques from abstract algebra to
                                analyze the PDS for key dynamics. ADAM will assign <i>x1</i> to <i>xn</i> to the
                                variables used in the logical model, and states of the dynamic model are represented as
                                vectors, where the first entry corresponds to the variable assigned to x1, and so on.
                                For example, the logical model of <a
                                    href="http://gin.univ-mrs.fr/GINsim/model_repository/MICROBIOLOGICAL%20REGULATORY%20NETWORKS/Phage%20Lambda/PhageLambda/description.html">Phage
                                Lambda</a> (left) is converted to the following PDS. ADAM determines the number of
                                states per variable from the logical model, in this example, there are 5 different
                                states per variable.<br>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        </p>
                        <center>

                        The Logical Model can be analyzed (using <i>Algorithms</i> or <i>Simulation</i>). This Phage
                        Lambda model has one fixed point or steady state, represented as <i>(2 0 0 0)</i>. This means,
                        that C1 is 2, a medium concentration, because the first (<i>x<b>1</b></i> = C1) entry is 2, and
                        the other three variables are 0, i.e., not expressed at all.<br>
                        <br>
                        Note: Currently ADAM is only compatible with GINsim 2.3. Please use GINsim version 2.3 to
                        generate your models in order to analyze them with ADAM.

                            The user can upload a text file (.txt) or directly enter the functions of a PDS. The <i>number

                            user's discrete network. Note that this must be a prime number. The software accepts
                            positive prime integers up to 99. This value gives the total number of states that a node in
                            the network can have. For example, if <i>number of states per node</i> = 3, then the
                            possible states for any node are 0, 1, and 2. If the system is <b>Boolean</b>, i.e., the
                            number of states per node is 2, then ADAM accepts functions in polynomial form, or in
                            Boolean form (see <a href="#boolean">Boolean Input Format</a>).

                            <i>x2</i>, etc. Function names are <i>f1</i>, <i>f2</i>, etc. The convention is that
                            <i>fk</i> is the function which describes the state transitions of the node represented by
                            <i>xk</i>. ADAM will use the functions from the input text box only when the user DOES NOT
                            select a file to upload. The functions should follow the following formatting rules:

                            The PDS can be analyzed (using <i>Algorithms</i> or <i>Simulation</i>). For small networks
                            (less than 10 nodes), the complete state space can be simulated and all attractors (fixed
                            points and limit cycles) are found. In addition to that, the size of each component, i.e.,
                            the basin of attraction, are determined. For larger networks, a simulation of the complete
                            state space is not possible. Instead, ADAM uses tools from computational algebra, to find
                            all fixed points or limit cycles of a given length. The algorithms that ADAM uses are fast
                            for sparse systems, a structure maintained by most biological systems. ADAM can easily
                            compute fixed points for systems with 50 or 100 nodes, as long as every node has only a few
                            neighbors in the wiring diagram, i.e., only a few variables appear in each function.

                                The <i>number of states per node</i> must be specified. It denotes the cardinality of

                        In probabilistic networks, fixed points are defined as state that <i>could</i> remain the same
                        when updated. The <i>stability</i> of a fixed point is its probability to not change in the next
                        iteration. Fixed points with stability 1 are <b>true fixed points</b>, as they can never
                        transition to another state. ADAM determines true fixed points of probabilistic networks by
                        simulation for smaller networks, or by using algorithms from computational algebra for systems
                        too complex for simulation. Bounded Petri Nets can be represented as probabilistic networks<sup>1</sup>.
                        In the terminology of petri nets, fixed points with stability one are <b>deadlocks</b>.

                            The user enters the <b>propensity matrix</b> entries. If they do not know the propensity

                            matrix should be 0.5. In the propensity matrix, the number of rows must be the number of
                            nodes (variables) in the network, and the number of columns must be 2 that the first column
                            is for activation and the second column is for degredation propensity. Propensity entries
                            must be seperated by a space and a number between 0 and 1. The sum of the activation and
                            degradation of a node does not have to be equal to 1. For example, the propensity matrix of
                            a 3-node boolean network must have 3 rows and 2 colums and can be:

                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Therefore, for the <b>first</b> node, 0.57 is the <b>activation propensity</b>, 0.05 is the
                            <b>degradation propensity</b>; for the <b>second</b> node, 0.40 is the <b>activation
                            propensity</b>, 0.70 is the <b>degradation propensity</b>; for the <b>third</b> node, 0.85
                            is the <b>activation propensity</b>, 0.15 is the <b>degradation propensity</b>. "Activation
                            Propensity" is the probability that the variable is being activated (increased) at the next

                            the network. For example, the initial state of a 3-node boolean network can be: 0 1 1 but

                            Probability Transition Matrix</b>". A steady state is the state where the system does not
                            change in time. In the example given for the (complete) transition table, the steady states
                            for that system are 0 1 0 and 1 0 1. However, a probability transition matrix is a huge
                            structure provides the probability of going each state to all possible states. Only <b>nonzero</b>
                            probabilities will be provided, i.e. if the probability of going from a state to another is
                            0, then it will not be shown in the probability transition matrix. Besides, the sum of all
                            transition probabilities from any specific state to all states must be 1. Here is an example
                            for the probability transition matrix of a 3-node boolean network:

                            <li>Pr (0 0 1 -&gt; 1 1 0) = 0.5</li>

                            <li>Pr (0 1 0 -&gt; 0 1 0) = 1</li>

                        </ul>

                            Pr (0 0 0 -&gt; 0 0 0) = 0.1 indicates that the probability of transitioning from 0 0 0 to 0
                            0 0 itself is 0.1. In addition, 0 0 1 transitions to 0 1 1 and 1 1 0 with the probability
                            0.5. Since 0 1 0 is one of the steady states, the probability of transitioning from 0 1 0 to
                            itself is of course 1. Note that the sum of all transition probabilities for 0 0 0 is 1 (=

                            ADAM will simulate dynamics for the <i>Simulation</i> option (11 nodes or less), meaning it
                            computes the transition states from all possible initializations. When simulating, ADAM will
                            output the analysis results as well as the graph of the state space. For <i>Algorithms</i>
                            ADAM uses algebra to solve for fixed points and limit cycles of a specified length. ADAM
                            uses a separate algorithm to compute dynamics in the case of <i>Conjunctive/Disjunctive</i>
                            Networks. Conjunctive Boolean networks consist of functions containing only one monomial
                            term, i.e. the functions use only the AND operator. Conversely, Disjunctive Boolean networks
                            consist of functions which use only the OR operator. Note that the <i>Conjunctive/Disjunctive</i>
                            option only works for functions defined in a Boolean ring, i.e. there can be only two states
                            per node. (see <a href="#numStates">What is the <i>number of states per node</i>?</a>)
                            Furthermore, <i>Conjunctive/Disjunctive</i> networks currently works only for strongly
                            connected graphs. When input is analyzed with either the <i>Algorithms</i> or <i>Conjunctive/Disjunctive
                            network</i> option, ADAM displays the fixed points and limit cycles in a table.

                    <div class="well">
                        <p>
                            There are two options for analysis without simulation. The first is specifically for
                            conjunctive/disjunctive networks. If the user has a Boolean network consisting solely of AND
                            operators (conjunctive) or solely of OR operators (disjunctive), then ADAM will compute the
                            number of fixed points and limit cycles according to algorithms from Salam Jarrah et
                            al.<sup>2</sup>. It will also output what the fixed points and limit cycles are using
                            Gröbner basis computations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second option is for general networks. For networks that are too large to analyze with
                            simulation, we use Gröbner bases. The user specifies a limit cycle length they would like to
                            find, and our algorithm finds all limit cycles of that length.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the worst case, computing Gröbner bases for a polynomial system has a complexity of
                            doubly exponential in the number of solutions to the system. However, in practice Gröbner
                            bases are computable in a reasonable time. Furthermore, for sparse systems in a finite field
                            it is actually fairly quick. It has been shown that computing Gröbner bases in modular form
                            is much faster in general. <sup>3</sup> In addition, sparse polynomials mean that simpler
                            S-polynomials, usually of comparable length, will be added to the basis, which means less
                            computation is involved. In short, the sparse structure of biological systems is preserved
                            by Gröbner bases, causing our algorithms to be both efficient and fast.

                        <p>
                            If the analysis is too slow, it is probably due to a combination of: having too many nodes
                            in the network, having functions that are too dense, and searching for limit cycle lengths
                            that are too long. Finding a limit cycle of length <i>n</i> involves composing the system of
                            equations <i>n</i> times - this means functions become more dense as <i>n</i> increases. As
                            explained in <a href="#how">How is the Analysis without Simulation implemented?</a>, the
                            Gröbner basis algorithm is faster for sparse polynomials.
